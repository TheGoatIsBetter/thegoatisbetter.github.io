The game features a controllable magnet on a rope as its main mechanic. Brainstorming happened over a virtual whiteboard, before moving to attempting several different prototypes for both the rope and the magnet. For the first full day of the jam, it was me and another programmer prototyping the magnet and rope respectively, with the other guy eventually joining me on the magnet when we thought the rope was good. For days two and three, I split off to program the other important unimplemented pieces of the game to ensure we had something while he continued to build off the ideas from our prototypes and make tweaks based on mine and another designer's testing and vice versa.<br></p>

It implements bullets that can shoot bullets, including in sine-wave patterns, as well as bullets that are actually a generated circle of bullets that move like a single bullet and can optionally face inwards.  Additionally; I worked with L√ñVE2D's GLSL-like shader language to create several shaders to create interesting backgrounds and a blizzard effect.</p>

It was imperative that no character offend anyone around the globe, despite the necessity that ill-mannered and ill-intentioned characters would need to exist given the subject matter, and so research was done to diversify characters as much as possible, and outsiders from a variety of backgrounds were brought in to read over dialogue and give feedback on assets as soon as we were able.  Additionally; I personally did lots of marketing and market research, and strongly pushed the use of a variety of compositional techniques to achieve our targeted emotions.</p>

The process of creating each level consisted of a run-through of the target world to give myself an idea of how difficult the level should be for me to complete, followed by a run-through for mass-screenshots and analysis.  Since the ideas in the set design and each mechanic is used in tend to repeat or otherwise be simple chains of other ideas, I take note of what stands out to me during this run as well.  My next step was to actually block out the level, based loosely on sketches of chains of the aforementioned level design idea notes, but also with the context of jump distance, speed, and pacing, as well as making sure multiple paths existed, including a more difficult path for acquiring a collectible bandage.  Once everything felt right regarding pacing, I would go through and start plotting out the set design, being careful to stay within object-count limits and use the limited layers to their fullest capacity.</p>

My process involved playing through part of the game while taking screenshots at inspirational points, similar to what I did for the Super Meat Boy Level Collection.  The biggest difference is that I had to take into account differing lengths of stages compared to the main game, and that my ‚Äúoverworld‚Äù was only 3 rooms so I could focus my time on the platforming challenges of each stage.</p>

                    <p id="project-shortdesc"><em>Desiree's Lab</em> is a <em>Deltarune</em> level focusing on a custom secret boss.  I developed this alongside a friend as they were doing their own <em>Deltarune</em> level, so we could exchange information and both accomplish more with the time we had.  I focused mostly on the boss fight itself, but also made sure the ambiance building up to the fight felt right.  I dove into writing shader-code in L√ñVE2D's GLSL-like shader-language as a way to make whacky backgrounds that hint towards the phases of the fight, each of which has different affects on boss and player stats as the flashy secret boss gimmick that <em>Deltarune</em> secret bosses have.  The backgrounds themselves were <em>Earthbound</em>-inspired, taking from </em>Deltarune's</em> own inspiration, and since it was meant to be difficult, I additionally decided to lean into <em>Deltarune's</em> <em>Touhou</em> inspiration for bullet-pattern inspiration.</p>

The three core pieces can be summed up as; interesting and consistent art, a fun core concept, and good feedback.  An example of elaboration for ‚Äúinteresting and consistent art‚Äù could be how the simple geometric shapes from Thomas Was Alone, the stylistic choices of any Nintendo game, or how the beautifully composed Metal Gear Solid series supports their gameplay, narrative, and everything else about what each respective game's identity is.<br></p>

                    <p id="project-shortdesc"><em>Magna Fisher</em> is a 2D magnet fishing adventure game. It was developed in Godot using GDScript. The game features a controllable magnet on a rope as its main mechanic. Brainstorming happened over a virtual whiteboard, before moving to attempting several different prototypes for both the rope and the magnet. For the first full day of the jam, it was me and another programmer prototyping the magnet and rope respectively, with the other guy eventually joining me on the magnet when we thought the rope was good. For days two and three, I split off to program the other important unimplemented pieces of the game to ensure we had something while he continued to build off the ideas from our prototypes and make tweaks based on mine and another designer's testing and vice versa.<br></p>

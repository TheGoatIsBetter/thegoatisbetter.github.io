# Graduation Snapshot of UAT

This part of the site represents a snapshot of the end of my time at UAT.  It uses the same style as the rest of the site has for it's existence thus far, but only includes the section of the site dedicated to the SIP and Boards UAT graduation requirements, along with the expanded, read more, pages that existed for some projects at the time.

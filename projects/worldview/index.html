            <p id="body">
                &emsp;World view is an endless arcade-like twin-stick shooter, loosely inspired by bullet hell games. 
                Blast away and shoot enemies as your vision slowly expands. But be wary, the battlefield is not what it seems...

            <p id="body">
                &emsp;My role in the development of <em>World view</em> was primarily that of conceptualization, menu design/programming, 
                audio programming, debugging, and implementing minor features.
            </p>

            <p id="heading">
                The Menus
            </p>

            <p id="body">
                &emsp;<em>World view</em> was actually probably the most fun and smooth game jam I've done.  Even debugging everything went smoothly.
                As such, there really isn't all THAT much to show regarding process.  The more interesting thing I did was probably my work on the menus, though
                it's worth a quick mention that I was responsible for the idea of the setting as well as how it could decieve (though not the zoom out).  I was also
                the guy that pushed for it to be a twin-stick shooter rather than a rail-shooter.  I was ALSO the guy who programmed the audio system.
            </p>

            <p id="body">
                &emsp;For the menus, I figured I wanted them to be more interesting than a lot of the menus I've thrown together in the past.  As such, I opted to spend
                more than 2-3 hours on them and instead spend a good chunk of the jam making them work.  I trusted my fellow programmer to be able to do well with the main
                game as he's done various shoot-em-ups before.  If he did have trouble he could signal me and I could hop on over to help.
            </p>

            <p id="body">
                &emsp;I'll let the menus themselves do the talking.
